			<h3>RF Online</h3>
			<p>
			Originally named 'Rising Force', (Korean: 라이징 포스) is a 3D MMORPG developed by CCR.
			A mixture of science fiction and classic fantasy, RF Online (or RFO, as many of its players call it) 
			is set in a distant planet in the Novus system where magic exists alongside high technology. 
			Like most MMORPGs it follows the typical fantasy setting complete with swords and sorcery, 
			but it also emphasizes the three-way Race vs. Race vs. Race (RvRvR) concept and modern/futuristic 
			technology such as mecha and nuclear weapons. Playable races are Accretia(Cyborgs), Bellato(Dwarves)
			and Cora (Elves).

			<h3>Final Fantasy 8</h3>
			<p>
			 The eighth installment in the Final Fantasy series. The game is the second Final Fantasy developed 
			 for both PlayStation and PC.
			 <br>
			 “At the forefront of a rising tide of violence brought on by Galbadia's war declaration is a SeeD cadet 
			 named Squall Leonhart. Serious to a fault, Squall has earned himself the reputation of being a lone wolf.
			 A chance encounter with the free-spirited Rinoa Heartilly, however, turns his universe upside down. 
			 Having thrived on discipline, Squall finds Rinoa's carefree attitude fascinating. Yet there is no time to ponder 
			 these thoughts, for the job of dealing with the sorceress behind Galbadia's irrational hostility has fallen to SeeD and Squall.”
